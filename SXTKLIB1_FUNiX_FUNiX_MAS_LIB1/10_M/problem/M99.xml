    <label>You are a Project manager in a Multinational company. A project is starting to create a dedicated team responsible for booking the business trips of the employees &#x2013; flights, hotels, etc. You are planning quality and you learn from the managers that they are often given a very short notice for their travels &#x2013; sometimes even for the next day. You need to define a measurable metric to check that the quality requirement is being met. What metric should you use in this case?</label>
