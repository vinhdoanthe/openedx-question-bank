    <label>You are managing a project where the client is a big insurance company. The project is about extending the services your company is providing to the same client. During planning, all details on scope, cost and service quality requirements have been agreed and described in the contract. Few months into the execution, the client explains the service is not satisfactory and they do not want to continue if this is not improved. As a PM you check the service provided (actuals) against the agreed quality requirements (targets). You see, the targets are met. You explain to the client, but they insist the performance is not satisfactory and needs to be improved. What would you do?</label>
