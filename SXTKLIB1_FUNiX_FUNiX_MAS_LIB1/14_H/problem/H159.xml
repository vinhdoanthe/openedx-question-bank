    <label>You are managing a software development project. The software is intended to help employees transfer big data files quickly and easily. So far, they have been always exchanging the files via e-mail. The entire company should switch to the new software as of the 1st of March. One of the risks you have analyzed is around the possible malfunctioning of the software, resulting in lost files during the first 2 months after implementation. What would you apply as a mitigation action to reduce the severity of this risk?</label>
