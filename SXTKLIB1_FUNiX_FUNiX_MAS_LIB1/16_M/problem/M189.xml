    <label>You are managing a software engineering project, when two team members come to you with a conflict. The
lead developer has identified an important project risk: you have a subcontractor that may not deliver on time.
Another developer doesn&#x2019;t believe that the risk is likely to happen; however, you consult the lessons learned
from previous projects and discover that subcontractors failed to deliver their work on two previous projects.
You decide that the risk is too big; you terminate the contract with the subcontractor, and instead hire additional
developers to build the component. Both team members agree that this has eliminated the risk. Which of the
following BEST describes this scenario?</label>
