    <label>As part of a construction project, the project sponsor  asks what is the budget needed for the flooring activities. The area to be covered is approximately  496 sq. ft. A special flooring material has been selected to fit into the overall building design. The price of the material, offered by the vendor, is $97 per sq. ft. As a PM, what figure would you request as budget for the flooring (including buffer)?</label>

      <choice correct="false">48000</choice>
      <choice correct="false">49000<choicehint>This is a good answer as you are factoring around 10% of buffer on top of the basic estimate ($48 112). In similar works, the risk of needing more materials than the basic calculation is very high.</choicehint></choice>
